    <div class="cv-title">PERSONAL STATEMENT</div>
    In 2010 I finished my degree in Computing gaining a 2:1 with Honours. Since I graduated I have been working for
    a
    Telecommunications company as part of the Software Development team. I was first brought on-board as a web
    developer
    to utilise my skills in languages such as PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. However I was keen to expand my
    abilities to other areas which included learning new skills such as networking and Android mobile development. I
    feel I am a big part of making the team successful, this includes developing a custom PHP MVC framework which
    vastly
    improved productivity and I also feel I was instrumental in training a strong team of developers. I believe my
    assets also include time management, problem solving, being self-motivated and dependable.

        <div class="cv-employ-title">Mainstream Digital - Cirencester, Gloucestershire</div>
        <div class="cv-employ-subtitle">IT Developer, June 2010 to present</div>
        During my time at Mainstream I have gained a lot of experience creating high quality public and internal web
        portals. Most of the systems I developed involved automating procedures which were previously done manually
        and
        developing new ideas and products to sell to our customers. My job also involves managing a large workload
        and
        leading other members of the team. It also includes designing the systems from the beginning, this includes
        database design and normalisation, writing specifications and tasks and designing the interface.
        <br>
        Within the first year of working at the company I had designed, developed, maintained and enhanced the
        company’s
        Intranet which improved the day to day working of the company for all members of staff. I designed the
        Intranet
        to allow web portals to be added to it and implemented multi-layered permissions to allow some users
        functionality
        that was hidden from others. One of many web portals on the company Intranet I developed was a ticket system
        which
        logs customer faults and enquiries. Since its creation the Intranet has become an integral part of the
        company and as
        a result could no longer function efficiently without it.
        <br>
        While working at Mainstream I also developed skills in networking and server maintenance. This included
        building
        Linux servers, installing the programs needed from the CLI and being responsible for connectivity, security
        and
        performance of these servers. When I first joined the team we were responsible for maintaining two servers
        and
        now we control over one hundred.
        <br>
        I also spent time developing an Android mobile application which involved tracking a phone’s location and
        uploading the data to a central server. Once the data had reached the server the locations were displayed on
        a web portal.
        As I had never produced an Android application before this was a great learning experience.
        <br>
        Recently I have developed a public web portal for Mainstream customers where they configure and monitor the
        different products and services they have with the company.

        <div class="cv-employ-subtitle">Web Developer, June 2008 to June 2009</div>
        The job at Axiell was part of my University placement year. They initially contracted me for 40 weeks which
        was
        then extended to 52 weeks after the company acknowledged the high quality work I was producing. My role at
        the
        company was to work on a project with over 15 web developers from 4 countries in Europe. My core duty was to
        create well
        designed maintainable interface using HTML and CSS. The project also required frequent validation,
        accessibility
        and usability testing, which I volunteered to take on and ultimately became my responsibility. Working for
        the
        company involved managing a large workload, good communication and team work in addition to excellent
        technical skills
        in HTML and CSS.
