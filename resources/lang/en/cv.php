I was first brought on-board as a Developer to utilise my skills in languages such as PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. However, I was keen to expand my abilities to other areas which included learning new skills in the DevOps role. I feel I am a big part of making the team successful, this includes implementing the Laravel framework, which has vastly improved productivity.

Within the first year of working at the company I had established the companyâ€™s Intranet, which improved the day to day working for all members of staff. More recently I have developed a public web portal for our customers where they configure and monitor the different products and services they have with the company. Although the company was fully established when I joined, my team was treated as a start up, therefore, I have been able to influence high level decisions such as programming techniques and tools and vastly expanding the company data centre infrastructure, showing I am motivated and proactive.',
